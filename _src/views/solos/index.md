### Solo [SLP016] EP-Release (2015)

"*Solo* [SLP016] is the Slip debut of Berlin-based composer Andreas Dzialocha: a collection of lilting electric bass melodies refracted through a tangled network of live computer processing. *Solo*‘s ruptured nocturnes are intimate duets between instrument and machine, with Dzialocha eloquently responding to randomised pulsing reverbs, filters, and compressors, which snatch his delicate motifs into virtual space in real time."

"The Top 20 Tapes Of 2015" (The Quietus *Spool’s Out with Tristan Bath: The Top 20 Tapes Of 2015*)

"We may have to reassess the term *bass music*. [...] with the Berlin-based experimentalist channelling his electric bass themes through an array of filters, reverbs and compressors, randomly recomposing every note into unruly soundscapes. The scope of both high and low end noises on display is dizzying, and Dzialocha’s musical themes seem seethe with compelling menace, and the occasional flash of blissful splendour (the reverb soaked chiming on *6*). Far from a Solo, the tape’s in fact a duet between man and machine, covering swathes of sonic ground neither could cover alone. Frankly both *Solo* and *Got Gills?* deserve to sit alongside the likes of Okkyung Lee’s Ghil and Fred Frith’s Guitar Solos as vital stepping stones in tapping untapped sonic potential from long-serving instruments."
