Andreas Dzialocha (*1988) is an electric bass player, composer and developer. His work consists of both digital and physical environments, spaces or platforms for performers and listeners. Through the last years Andreas developed an electric bass technique which treats the instrument more as a filter and sound generator leading to a both organic and electroacoustic aesthetic at the same time. The computer itself serves as a customised tool, not only as an artistic device but also as a political, social or philosophical medium, questioning frameworks or dealing with decentralized systems. He is founder of the berlin-based ensemble Serenus Zeitblom Oktett, co-publisher of the self-curated magazine platform BLATT 3000 and co-founder of the label Hyperdelia. He studied art history, musicology, media philosophy and computer science in Berlin where he also lives and works.
