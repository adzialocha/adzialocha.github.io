*Segmente A* is a interactive multichannel audio-video installation for computer, large screen and 4 speakers developed with Unreal Script (UDK), Java, C++, Processing, Houdini, Maya in a collaboration of AEAEAE, Hans-Henning Korb, Jonas Wendelin, Andreas Dzialocha, Sehera Nawaz und Leon Eixenberger.

The *Score* consists of a landscape, a virtual space being traveled by the user in a one-by-one experience. In interaction with the users behavior, a complex musical logic described by four autark systems generates a orchestral piece of microtonal clusters, impulses and inner structures - weaved inside this musical body. Every single path of a user constitutes an individual dramaturgy. It all occurs with great subtleness, so there is no direct conscious interaction between the user and the environment, rather the environment imposes a decision making process onto the user, which again makes the user react and inform the piece.

Based one the UDK there is different *hacks* describing the composition, sampling the music, caring about the orchestration and the multi-channel handling inside this ego shooter game engine. Additionally a self-written external *map editor* (written in Java) characterizes instrumentation and several parameters of the musical systems. This already implies a new approach to composition as a more abstract spacial process, understanding orchestration as a huge virtual two-dimensional environment of sound-colors, systems and dynamics. Composer, Interpret and Score are musical terms which are impossible to be clearly defined in Segmente A, representing an complex chaotic world in the sense of a system which changes rapidly with small changes of its parameters.
