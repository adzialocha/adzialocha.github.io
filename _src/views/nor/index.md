NOR is a software for improvised music in a highly artifical environment. Inspired by techniques from modern studio sound production, the musicians are separated in five different rooms in one building, hearing each other via earphones, controlling extreme filters of theire instrument signals through NOR.

Substracting all musical physicality - like room acoustics, body communication or visual contact - the musicians communicate through the NOR interface and theire filtered instruments, being able to choose between a set of microphones, extreme compression, extreme reverb and a radical bandpass EQ filter as theire artificial musical parameters. Inside a 6th room all audio signals and filter commands come together, being then played through speakers and / or headphones for the audience.

The audience is able to walk between the rooms in the building, choosing between different perspectives.

NOR is a mobile app client written for smartphones communicating via WiFi to a server inside the building. The server gathers the commands from the musicians, parallely all audio signals are being collected and filtered here (whether directly via multicore or radio link for larger distances depending on the buildings architecture) and are sent back to the musicians earphones and to the speaker room for the audience.
