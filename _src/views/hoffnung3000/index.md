HOFFNUNG 3000 is a festival for music, art and theory. It is an experiment in social, artistic and theoretical collaboration. HOFFNUNG 3000 does not have any curatorial theme, instead we ask: How do we organise ourselves in our social, artistic & theoretical communities? HOFFNUNG 3000 is not simply a festival but rather a process of organising a festival, a festival that creates itself. Through each and every participant.

HOFFNUNG 3000 invites 30 practitioners of all fields and backgrounds to join into a collective creation mode. There will be no curated programme, instead all 30 participants are themselves the curators. All participants will be anonymous, no name or information will be displayed â€“ neither to the public nor to the other participants.
